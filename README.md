# Neural network compression with coresets

Authors: Ksenia Korovina, Aleksandr Podkopaev

To reproduce the experiments, one should be able to run
```bash
python train.py [with args]
python sparsify.py [with args]
```

## TODO:

- [x] CoreNet
- [ ] SVD for baseline comparison
- [ ] Base experiments: for a few architectures, range over sparsification and build hists
